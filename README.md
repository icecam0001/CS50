# CS50
All of my submissions for CS50's fun projects: contains all problem sets except birthdays. Each solution includes my own implementation and approach to solving each problem.


## What I Built

- **Stock Trading Site** (finance/) - Web app for buying and selling stocks with real-time prices
- **DNA Matching** (dna/) - Program that matches DNA sequences to identify people
- **Image Filters** (filter-more/) - Adds filters like blur and edge detection to images
- **Memory Card Game** (trivia/) - Simple web-based trivia game
- **Music Database** (songs/) - SQL queries for analyzing song/artist data
- **File Recovery** (recover/) - Recovers deleted JPEGs from memory cards
- **Spell Checker** (speller/) - Fast spell checker using hash tables
- Plus various algorithms and data structure implementations in C and Python

```

For web projects (like finance/):
```bash
flask run
```

## Tools Used

## About CS50
CS50 is Harvard's intro to computer science course. It covers everything from basic coding to web development. You can find the course at [CS50's website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x).

## Notes
- Solutions might not be perfect but they all pass CS50's checks
- Made some optimizations where I could, especially in the C programs
- Web projects might need API keys or database setup to work
- Feel free to check out the code but remember to follow CS50's guidelines
